(http://howtoplay.mystrikingly.com).
      You may be reading this website because you are an Edgeworker (http://edgeworker.org), a Riftwalker (http://riftwalkers.org), a Possibilitator (http://possibilitators.xyz), a Seed (http://becomeaseed.mystrikingly.com), a Villager (http://villaging.mystrikingly.com), a Whole Permaculturist (http://wholepermaculture.org), a Healer (http://3phasehealing.org), an Earth Guardian (http://earthguardian.xyz), a Village Weaver (http://villageweavers.mystrikingly.com), an Evolutionary (http://evolutionaries.mystrikingly.com), or a Gameworld Builder (http://gameworldbuilder.org).

      The more intensely it is revealed that modern culture (http://patriarchy.strikingly.com) is unable to create a bright future for humanity, the faster next cultures emerge (http://archearchy.org). Those experiments where neither masculine (patriarchy) nor feminine (matriarchy) qualities dominate, where instead, there is creative collaboration between authentically initiated adult women and authentically initiated adult men for a regenerative future, these are thriving cultures of archearchy. This website is part of the StartOver.xyz free-to-play massively-multiplayer online-and-offline personal-transformation matrix-building thoughtware-upgrade adventure-game (http://howtoplay.mystrikingly.com). By reading this website all the way through you earn yourself 1 Matrix Point. By actually doing each experiment suggested on this website you earn additional Matrix Points, for real, not just in a fantasy world. We have the theory that if we can together earn 1 million new Matrix Points, we will cause a change for the better in the status quo of human beings on Earth. You can register your Matrix Points at http://startover.xyz.
